## 🎯 Problem Statement
Millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals use sign language as their primary 
mode of communication. However, most people around them — in hospitals, schools, 
and public spaces — cannot understand sign language. This creates serious 
communication barriers in everyday life.

## 💡 Our Solution
SignBridge AI is a browser-based, AI-powered application that:
- Detects hand gestures in real time using your webcam
- Recognizes ASL (American Sign Language) letters A–Z
- Converts signs into text and spoken speech
- Requires zero installation — works directly in any browser

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **MediaPipe Hands** — Hand landmark detection
- **Web Speech API** — Text to speech
- **MyMemory API** — Multi-language translation
- **Claude AI (Anthropic)** — AI sentence formation from signs
- **Vanilla JS / HTML5 / CSS3** — Frontend
- **Netlify** — Deployment

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Download `index.html`
2. Open it in **Chrome** or **Edge**
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Go to **Communicate** → Click **Start Camera**
5. Show ASL signs to the camera

> ⚠️ Camera requires HTTPS or localhost. Use a local server if needed:
> ```
> python -m http.server 8080
> ```
> Then open: `http://localhost:8080`

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Camera captures** your hand in real time
2. **MediaPipe** detects 21 hand landmarks (joints)
3. **Classifier** matches landmark geometry to ASL letters
4. **Arc fills** as you hold the sign steady (~1 second)
5. **Letter added** to sentence builder
6. **AI forms** a natural sentence from detected letters
7. **Speech API** reads the sentence aloud
